A simple app, demonstrating React and JavaScript `fetch` fundamentals, using Spotify's API. 

To begin, set your Spotify app's client id to `clientId` in `/utils/Spotify.js`.

`npm run start` runs this application on `localhost:3000`, which is also the redirect after authorization. Make sure your Spotify app's redirect uri is set to `redirectUri` in `/utils/Spotify.js`, as well. 

Once you have the app running, search for songs, artists, and albums. Add searched songs to a custom playlist, created and named by you. 

When satisfied with your selections, click `Save to Spotify` to do just that.

Now, check your Spotify account to see and listen to your new playlist, created through this app.
